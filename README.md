MovieLens Machine Learning Project

# Datasets : 
The MovieLens movie ratings data is provided by GroupLens Research in datasets ranging in size from 100K to 20 million. There is a "Latest" dataset that includes more recent ratings data up to 2016. Our team chose to use the stable 20 million (MovieLens 20M) count dataset and the Latest dataset.
